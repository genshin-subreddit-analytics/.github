# Genshin Subreddit Analytics

This project aims to gather and store comments from subreddits that discuss the popular game "Genshin Impact". The project is automated and operates on a regular basis to collect all posted comments periodically. The collected comments are then analyzed for sentiment to determine the overall emotional tone of each comment. The results of this analysis are then presented visually through Tableau, which makes it easy to interpret and analyze the data. By using automated data collection and sentiment analysis methods, this project provides useful insights into the opinions and attitudes of the various Genshin Impact communities on Reddit.
