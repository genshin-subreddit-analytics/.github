# Genshin Subreddit Analytics

The "Genshin Subreddit Analytics" project aims to collect and archive comments related to the popular game "Genshin Impact" on Reddit. The project is automated and runs on a regular schedule to capture all comments posted within the last two weeks. The collected comments are then processed through sentiment analysis to determine the prevailing emotional tone of each comment. The results of this analysis are then visualized using Tableau, allowing for easy interpretation and analysis of the data. By leveraging automated data collection and sentiment analysis techniques, this project provides valuable insights into the opinions and attitudes of the Genshin Impact community on Reddit.
